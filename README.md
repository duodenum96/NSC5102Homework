# NSC5102Homework

MATLAB code to generate figures for the homework given by Prof. Maler for NSC5102.

Selected question: Modelling neurons. Students preferring this question should first consult with Dr. Maler. (a) the H-H equations are too difficult to understand. Describe some of the simpler action potential models based on dynamical systems theory. (b) If a student is competent with a programming language, e.g., Matlab, C++ or Python, they can model any aspect related to the role of any VGA channel on neuronal activity and spiking patterns.

NapK.m: Function to simulate persistent sodium plus potassium model and generate phase portraits
figures.m: Code to generate figures.

Note that there is some manual (=interactive) interventions on the generated figures, such as annotations etc.
